    I’m a cybersecurity student passionate about building hands-on, accessible learning experiences that bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.
    My favorite work lies at the intersection of education and technical exploration — creating labs, environments, and demos that not only teach, but challenge and engage.

  <p>
    Currently, I'm the President of the <a href="https://www.bcinfosec.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">InfoSec Club</a> at
    <a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">Bellevue College</a>,
    where I lead weekly cybersecurity labs and workshops. These sessions cover topics like exploiting EternalBlue, building out homelabs, and navigating Windows 11 attack ranges — all designed to give students a strong, practical foundation in cybersecurity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of the club, I maintain a personal homelab, build static websites with
    <span class="highlight">Hugo</span> and
    <span class="highlight">Astro</span>, and create educational content for our club's
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BC-InfoSec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="highlight-link">YouTube channel</a>.
    I’ve also developed cloud-based projects like an <span class="highlight">AWS</span>-hosted photo bucket app and several small tools using
    <span class="highlight">Python</span> and
    <span class="highlight">Gradio</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my spare time, I’m usually out hiking, camping, or behind a camera lens.
    I also love experimenting with new operating systems, troubleshooting tech for friends and family, or smashing headcrabs in
