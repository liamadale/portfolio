# Photo Repository React App

A comprehensive full-stack web application that allows users to upload, organize, and manage their photo collections with secure cloud storage and an intuitive user interface.

## Key Features

- **Photo Upload & Management**: Drag-and-drop interface for easy photo uploads
- **Cloud Storage**: Integration with AWS S3 for reliable, scalable storage
- **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts and session management
- **Photo Organization**: Tag and categorize photos for easy retrieval
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## Architecture

### Frontend (React)
- Modern React with hooks and functional components
- Responsive UI with intuitive photo management interface
- Real-time upload progress and status indicators
- Image optimization and lazy loading

### Backend (Flask)
- RESTful API design with Flask
- Secure file upload handling and validation
- Database integration for metadata storage
- JWT-based authentication system

### Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
- **S3**: Secure, scalable photo storage
- **EC2**: Application hosting and deployment
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for user and photo metadata

## Technical Challenges Solved
